Create a web page using a text editor. Name the file with your name and the number of the assignment. Submit the assignment via D2L by 5:00 on the due date.

There are several files that need to be sent in with each assignment. Be sure to zip all the files. Your pages won't display correctly without them.

Center a heading above the table. Call it Television Sitcoms. Use Arial font.

Create a table. Each row of the table should display the title, the years it aired, its network, the setting, the graphic, a star, their character and the synopsis for five shows. Use a script font for the title. Link the title and the graphic to its webpage. Use Arial font for the table. Right justify the numbers. Put column headings in your table. Make the table 80% of the width of your window. Set the background color of the table to ivory. Set the cell padding to 10px. Put a green border 3px wide around the cells.

Use styles to format the table and the header.

Put the graphics in a folder. Be sure to include the folder when you submit your assignment.
