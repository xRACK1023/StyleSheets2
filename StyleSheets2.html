                    Boston Red Sox. The show's ensemble cast introduced in the pilot episode 
                    are waitresses Diane Chambers and Carla Tortelli, second bartender Coach 
                    Ernie Pantusso, and regular customers Norm Peterson and Cliff Clavin. Later

                    the Korean War (1950â€“53). The "4077th MASH" was one of several 
                    surgical units in Korea. Early seasons aired on network prime time while the Vietnam War 
                    was still ongoing; the show was forced to walk the fine line of 
                    commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest 
                    against it. The show's discourse, under the cover of comedy, 
                    often questioned, mocked, and grappled with America's role in the Cold War.</td>
