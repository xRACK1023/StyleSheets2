                    the Korean War (1950–53). The "4077th MASH" was one of several 
                    surgical units in Korea. Early seasons aired on network prime time while the Vietnam War 
                    was still ongoing; the show was forced to walk the fine line of 
                    commenting on that war while at the same time not seeming to protest 
                    against it. The show's discourse, under the cover of comedy, 
                    often questioned, mocked, and grappled with America's role in the Cold War.</td>

                    man, seemingly prejudiced against everyone who is not like him or his idea of 
                    how people should be. Archie's wife Edith (Jean Stapleton) is sweet and 
                    understanding, though somewhat naïve and uneducated; her husband sometimes 
                    disparagingly calls her "dingbat". Their one child, Gloria (Sally Struthers), 
                    is generally kind and good-natured like her mother, but displays traces of her 
                    father's stubbornness and temper; unlike them, she is a feminist. Gloria is 
                    married to college, later graduate student, later college instructor Michael 
                    Stivic (Reiner)–referred to as "Meathead" by Archie–whose values are likewise 
                    influenced and shaped by the counterculture of the 1960s.</td>

                    make him popular with his fellow citizens. His professional life, however, is 
                    complicated by the repeated gaffes of his inept deputy, Barney Fife 
                    (Don Knotts). Barney is Andy's cousin and best friend. At home, widower

                    skills season after season, and Aunt Bee's ill-considered romances and 
                    adventures cause her nephew concern.</td>
